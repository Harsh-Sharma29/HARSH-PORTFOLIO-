        longDescription: "Built an autonomous multi-source research agent capable of orchestrating information retrieval across web, academic and document sources. Implemented iterative reasoning loops that self-critique and refine answers, boosting factual accuracy by 40% compared to single-shot approaches.",
        caseStudy: "The core challenge was chaining multiple LLM calls without hallucination drift. I implemented a verify→refine loop where each iteration is scored against source material. Citations are tracked end-to-end so every claim is traceable.",
        challenges: [
            "Preventing hallucination compounding across reasoning steps",
            "Balancing latency vs. thoroughness in multi-hop retrieval",

        caseStudy: "Migrated from a monolith to event-driven microservices. Each service owns its data, communicating via message queues. The payment service uses saga pattern for distributed transactions, guaranteeing consistency without a single point of failure.",

            "Maintaining data consistency across distributed services",

        longDescription: "Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system enabling natural-language queries over large PDF repositories. Achieved sub-2-second response times even on 500+ page documents by using hierarchical chunking and re-ranking.",
        caseStudy: "Traditional keyword search completely fails on dense technical PDFs. I built a pipeline: ingest → chunk → embed → store in Pinecone → hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse) → LLM synthesis. The re-ranker filters top-K candidates before the final generation step.",

        longDescription: "A multi-agent orchestration layer built with LangGraph. An intelligent control plane routes user queries to specialized agents (RAG, Research, Chat) with autonomous tool selection and execution. Features conversation memory, streaming responses, and document intelligence.",
        caseStudy: "The key insight was treating agent routing as a graph problem. Each node in the LangGraph DAG represents a capability. The control plane evaluates query intent, available tools, and conversation history before choosing the execution path — no rigid if/else trees.",
